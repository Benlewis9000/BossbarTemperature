# BossbarTemperature
Spigot plugin that simulates temperatures via the BossBar. Native to Spigot 1.13.2, untested on other versions.

This project is actively maintained; upcoming features will include the ability to add different seasons, degrees of randomness to the daily weather, and a better algorithm for calculating temperatures (e.g. Bezier curves instead of sine wave transformation).

**Commands:**
  - /temp
    - Main command to configure/reload plugin
    - *bossbartemperature.admin*
    
**Note:** Pending the completion of PluginToolsAPI, this project is subject to a rewrite and will be rebranded as "Forecast".
